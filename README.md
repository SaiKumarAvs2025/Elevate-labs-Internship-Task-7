I conducted a thorough analysis of my Google Chrome extensions with a focus on privacy and security. As part of this process, I carefully reviewed the permissions granted to each installed extension to ensure they aligned with their intended functionality.

During the review, I identified and blocked or removed suspicious extensions that requested unnecessary or excessive permissions, which could potentially pose security or privacy risks. By doing this, I reduced the chances of background data tracking, unauthorized access, and system performance issues.

This proactive step enhances the overall security of my browser environment by ensuring that only trusted, necessary, and well-behaved extensions remain active. Going forward, I plan to regularly audit installed extensions to maintain a secure and efficient browsing experience.
